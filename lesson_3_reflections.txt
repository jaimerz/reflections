When would you like to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working on team project with remote colaborators

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

One scenario is that my remote repository might contain public information that I do not want to make accessible to the public yet
